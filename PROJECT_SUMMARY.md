- Run Dev Server (Ctrl+Shift+B)
- Build
- Preview
- Type Check
- Install Dependencies

**Extensions Recommended:**
- ESLint
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

### ✅ GitHub Integration

- Git repository initialized on `main` branch
- `.gitignore` configured for Node.js projects
- GitHub Actions workflow ready for automatic deployment
- Configured for GitHub Pages hosting

### ✅ Documentation

- `README.md` - Comprehensive project overview
- `SETUP.md` - Quick start and setup guide
- `LICENSE` - MIT License for open source
- Inline code comments for clarity

## 🚀 Getting Started Right Now

The dev server is currently running at:
**http://localhost:5173/AffinityMap/**

Try it out:
1. Add a few people using the toolbar
2. Drag their cards around
3. Add tags to categorize them
4. Use the filter to view by tags
5. Zoom and pan to explore

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Start Using It
The app is ready to use! Start adding people and organizing assignments.

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
# Create a repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AffinityMap.git
git push -u origin main

# Then enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
# Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
```

### 3. Customize for Your Needs

**Easy customizations:**
- Change colors in `src/components/PersonCard.tsx`
- Adjust default positions in `src/components/Board.tsx`
- Modify the grid size or appearance
- Add your own logo/branding

**Future enhancements to consider:**
- Visual connection lines between ministers and recipients
- Save/load functionality (localStorage or export to file)
- Import from CSV or spreadsheet
- Assignment validation rules
- Print-friendly view
- Multiple board views or tabs
- Search/filter by name

### 4. Learn the Codebase

Key files to understand:
- `src/App.tsx` - Main state management
- `src/components/Board.tsx` - Canvas and positioning logic
- `src/components/PersonCard.tsx` - Card rendering and interactions
- `src/components/Toolbar.tsx` - Controls and filtering
- `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

## 🛠️ Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Quality
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript types

# Deployment
git push origin main # Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages
```

## 📖 Architecture Decisions

**Why React?** - Component-based architecture perfect for this UI
**Why Vite?** - Fast dev server, optimized builds, great DX
**Why Tailwind?** - Rapid styling without leaving your components
**Why TypeScript?** - Catch errors early, better IDE support
**Why DND Kit?** - Modern, accessible drag-and-drop library

## 🎯 Project Goals Achieved

✅ Visual drag-and-drop interface  
✅ Zoomable and pannable canvas  
✅ Dual card representation  
✅ Tag-based filtering  
✅ Easy person management  
✅ GitHub Pages deployment ready  
✅ VSCode task integration  
✅ Full TypeScript support  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Open source with MIT license  

## 💡 Tips

- Use `Ctrl+Shift+B` to quickly start the dev server
- The app saves nothing yet - add persistence if needed
- Cards start in default positions - drag them to organize
- Each person appears twice by design (minister + recipient)
- Tags are created on-the-fly as you add them

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- No data persistence (refresh loses all data)
- No connection lines yet (visual connections between people)
- No import/export functionality yet
- No undo/redo yet
- Single board only (no multiple views)

These are all great opportunities for future development!
